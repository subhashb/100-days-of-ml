## Day 1: April 25, 2018

**Theme**: Scikit Tutorial

**Today's Progress**:
* Set up ML repo
* Started with Scikit-Learn Tutorial
* Analysed general Scikit Datasets
* Practised Linear Regression and Classification Learning with Iris and Diabetic Datasets

**Thoughts**:
* What are different mechanisms to arrive at the correct alpha (or hyper parameters)?
* Need to build or find frameworks what learn using different algorithms and choose one with the best prediction
