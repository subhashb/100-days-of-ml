## Day 1: April 25, 2018

**Theme**: Scikit Tutorial

**Today's Progress**:
* Set up ML repo
* Started with Scikit-Learn Tutorial
* Analysed general Scikit Datasets
* Practised Linear Regression and Classification Learning with Iris and Diabetic Datasets

**Thoughts**:
* What are different mechanisms to arrive at the correct alpha (or hyper parameters)?
* Need to build or find frameworks what learn using different algorithms and choose one with the best prediction

## Day 2: April 26, 2018

**Theme**: Scikit Tutorial

**Today's Progress**:
* Completed exercise on classifying digits with KNN and Linear Models
* Completed exercise on classifying Iris dataset using SVM
* Practised scoring and cross-validation mechanisms
* Completed exercise on plotting cross validation scores of an SVC estimator for different C params

**Thoughts**:
* Mechanisms to find and verify the correct hyper parameters seem to be built-in, and all seem to be based on trial and error!
* Need to dive deeper in matplotlib - seems to have amazing graphing abilities

## Day 2: April 26, 2018

**Theme**: Scikit Tutorial

**Today's Progress**:
* Practised GridSearch and Cross-validated estimators
* Completed exercise of finding optimal regularization parameter alpha
* Practised K-Means Clustering
* Understood Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering

**Thoughts**:
* `scipy.misc.imresize` seems to have been deprecated, and I couldn't find an alternative!
* Scipy tutorial makes a ton of assumptions on our current knowledge - Difficult to consume without background information=
